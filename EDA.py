    This project analyzes Agriculture Records from different States using a MYSQL database.
    It provides different Trends, Patterns and Relationships within the Data.
 
    **Features:**
    - View the Agricultural differences between Districts through the States.
    - Generate the different Queries for multiple scenarios.
    - Run SQL queries to explore insights.
